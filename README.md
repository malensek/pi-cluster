Pi Cluster Executor (picle)
===========================

Management scripts for building and maintaining a cluster of Raspberry Pi nodes. Instead of covering every possible use case, this framework is simple and opinionated. If your goal is getting a large number of Raspberry Pis up and running quickly, picle might be worth a look.

Key Components
* Arch Linux ARM (ALARM)
* SSH + Public Key Authentication
* NFS for shared state (optional)
