Provisioning New Machines
=========================

To add a new Raspberry Pi to the cluster, there are two options: generating a complete machine image from scratch, or cloning an existing machine.

Generation from scratch involves:
* Partitioning the target SD card
* Downloading the latest appropriate OS image
* Extracting the OS to the SD card and configuring the machine
Afterward, the SD card can be attached to the new device and powered up.
